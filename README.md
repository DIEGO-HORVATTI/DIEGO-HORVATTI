I am a developer with a passion for creating clean and efficient code, with over four years of experience in software development. My approach focuses on adopting best practices, such as design patterns and SOLID principles, and implementing unit and integration tests early in the development cycle. I deeply value intelligent typing, believing it increases code security and clarity. I am committed to collaborating with teams that strive for technical excellence and are dedicated to delivering high-quality products.
